# Image-Compression-Using-Machine-Learning
KMeans Clustering algorithm is used for Image Compression.
Image compression is compressing Image to lower quality from Original Quality. So, that less space should be ocupied in database.
So, By this We can say Many stuff can be deal through Machine learning Algorithms.
By Compression we can deal with more Storage of other data.
